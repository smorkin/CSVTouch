FIX

- Check if two columns have the same name
- Remove hideAddress code
- Remove check marks for files after exiting/entering app?
- Removing check marks does not seem to work with timer?


FEATURES


TEST

- Check error handling of bad parsing; could probably add better info


COMPLETED

- When looking at info for file, going back does not clear selection -> next click will be interpreted as clicking this file instead of the clicked one...
- Automatic analysis of fixed widths (i.e. max length / field)
