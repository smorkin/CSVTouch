FIX

- Check if two columns have the same name
- Remove check marks for files after exiting/entering app?
- Removing check marks does not seem to work with timer?
- Remove cached scroll position in items list view perhaps? Messy code, just for going out to file list and then back to the same file again, not sure it's worth it...
- All file handling stuff like download etc should move from CSV_TouchAppDelegate to some new class
- Large titles in Files view: Glitches.
    - When programmatically starting refresh, size is wrong. Apparently Apple bug, others sreport same thing.
    - When going back to Files from Items where large title does not zoom in. Culprit is hidesSearchBarWhenScrolling setting in items view which apparently makes navigation bar unusually sized so when popping, well, not correct behaviour.
    - When going back from FileDataView, after having re-downloaded the file visible in the view. Funnily enough, each download offsets the 'Files' title additionally, so click-click-click to re-download, and 'Files' will end up really far down.

FEATURES

- Search: When search string changes, check if we have a selection before, and if item still matches, scroll to it.
- Perhaps if scheduled downloads setting is on, there should be a setting for whether to use file list URL or the existing files?
- Fixed auto width: If word > width, replace last character with … . Problems abound, such that you still want to search with the missing text. But since we actually do have a separate container for lowercase string for row to search, we "just" have to create the lowercase string before adding the … at the end...
- Add custom CSS
- Add custom main color
- Add info panel when first time > 150 items in CSV Lite. Or better: The number of... can be colored red, with clicking -> info panel

TEST

- Check error handling of bad parsing; could probably add better info


COMPLETED

4.1
- Allow not sorting a file
- SKStoreReviewController
- Fixed crash when clicking multiple times to download a single file
- Update file info view with updated time when re-downloading from the view
- Allowing any number of files in CSV Lite

4.0.1
- Fixed slow searching


4.0
- When looking at info for file, going back does not clear selection -> next click will be interpreted as clicking this file instead of the clicked one...
- Automatic analysis of fixed widths (i.e. max length / field)
- Pinch-to-zoom gesture support in items list
- Pinch-to-zoom gesture support in details view
- Suspected crash bug: If having configured a automated refresh time, and popup about refreshing all files comes up while in items or details view, the actual file currently inspected might disappear -> app will crash... Not common scenario, but still.
- Similar crash bug, when interacting with a file / choosing to download from within the Files view while re-downloading files. Now UI in Files view completely disabled while downloading.
- Synchronize files: Add new setting in UI which will be used when refreshing all (will then save up all URLs, delete all files, and start downloading). But when downloading a file with URLs + settings, check if this key is set before deleting all files.
- Keyboard shortcuts
